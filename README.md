# Stellar Content and Star Formation in low-mass star-forming regions
## Overview

In the following Repository, attached are the codes with proper astrophysical relevance to completely study and understand a star-forming region along with young stellar objects/protostars. The codes employed were part of my master's project at the Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bengaluru. The main aim of the study was threefold:

(1) Characterize the stellar population and cluster morphology around selected IRAS sources.

(2) Finding properties of the parent molecular cloud, such as Temperature, Column Density, Distance, and Extinction.

(3) Spectral analysis of interesting sources to find signatures of star formation.

However, the spectral analysis section was done in _**IRAF**_, which is beyond the scope of this repository. We will be mainly focusing on the first two points.

**The codes will sequentially follow the order below:**

* Identifying Young Stellar Objects by applying cuts in various color-color diagrams, mostly in Near-Infrared and Mid-Infrared colors.
* Finding the spatial structure and distribution of these YSOs, based on statistical techniques (Minimum Spanning Tree, Nearest Neighbour).
*
